# jitter: formal definition
# The basic idea of jittered undersampling is to regularly decimate the interpolation grid, thus generating a coarse grid, and subsequently perturb the coarse-grid sample points on the fine grid.

# As for random undersampling according to a discrete uniform distribution, where each location is equally likely to be sampled, a discrete uniform distribution for the peturbation around the coarse-grid points is considered.

# γ repreesnts the undersampling factor, here taken to be odd, γ = 1, 3, 5, ...
γx,γy = 3,3;

# SizeN of the interpolation gird is assumed to be a multiple of γ so that the number of acquired points n = N/γ is an integer.
nx = 10;
Nx = γx*nx;

ny = 10;
Ny = γy*ny;

# Jittered-sampled data points given by
# y[i] = f_0[j] for i = 1,...,n
# and j = 0.5*(1-γ) + γ * i + ϵ_i
# where ϵ_i is an iid (assume distribution) integer between [-floor(ξ-1)/2,floor(ξ-1)/2].
# The jitter parameter, 0 <= ξ <= γ, relates to the size of the perturbation around the corase-grid.
